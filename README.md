## Usage

Just instantiate `producer!`s and `consumer!`s when you need.
Both those functions return a `core.async/chan`.

To send send a message to topic, send a message to the producer channel returned by `producer!`.

To receive a message from a topic, read the messages on the consumer channel returned by `consumer!`.

There is also a `worker!` facility that consumes a consumer channel and apply a function to each message received.

## Troubleshooting 
### Unresponsive kafka channels
core.async default pool-size may be too small if you have to many producers and consumers instantiated.
To increase the pool size you'll need to pass this java property to your app, or in java or in `:jvm-opts` project.clj lein section:
`-Dclojure.core.async.pool-size=<number of threads>`
The default for this property is 8.
